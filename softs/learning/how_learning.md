# How to overcome learning resistance
While learning, you will always face challenges and your 
mind will naturally start to resist<br>

You can use 4 steps to overcome resistance:<br>

### First step - Realize:
First you must become realize of this resistance, 
treat your mind as an instrument that gives signals. Analyze this signals.<br>
Monitor under what conditions negative signals arise:

1. Workflow
2. Nutrition
3. Sleep
4. Stress
5. Goals

Try to calculate parameters of bad day, sleep less 7 hour for example.

### Second step - Mindset:
Mindset - a set of attitudes, ideas and concepts that guide the mind. <br>
Carol Dweck, Stanford psychologist, told about two types of Mindset:
* Fixing
  * People don't change
  * Success depends on talent
  * People are divided into categories: technologists and humanities
  * Changes and challenges should be avoided
  * Choose the path of least resistance
  * Criticism is bad
  * Problems and failures are worth complaining about
* Growth
  * I can change
  * Success depends on work
  * Categories of people are just the current state and are interesting, but not destiny
  * Changes and challenge help growth
  * Efforts move forward
  * Criticism good information source
  * Complaining is pointless and distracts from what is truly valuable

The quality of life depends on its subjective perception.<br>
Resistance is good. This is a sign of growth. Don't miss the opportunity to grow.<br>

### Third step - Openness:
If you want get into a constant stupor - isolate yourself from others.<br>
Openness is key for your growth.<br>

1. <b>Ask questions</b>.<br> Formulating questions helps structure information.<br> Ask in text better than abstract ask in your mind.
2. <b>Communicate</b>.<br> It is very useful to see other people with similar problems to yours, their progress and experience.
3. <b>Get & Give Experience</b>.<br> Learn from other people's experiences to save time.<br>Share your experience and knowledge, this will allow you to better understand the topic yourself.

### Fourth step - Progress:
Starting to learn something new is always difficult.<br>
Beginners always ask where to start, ask to recommend a book, and then think about which one to start with.<br>
The main thing is to understand that 
you can start with any book because one book will not give you an understanding of the field.<br>
You need to study different sources to study the area from all sides and build a complete picture.<br>

1. On first learning step you get many pleasure. All simple and interesting.
2. On middle of learning way may fall down motivation. It normally. Continue to collect information, remembering that it will form a big, understandable picture.
3. Donâ€™t get hung up on one source, maybe something else will do.
4. In last moment you need notice a decrease in the value of new information. Then you need to expand or change the area of study.

A prolonged lack of progress is a sign that it is worth changing your learning strategy.
Good practice it notice your progress. It help up your motivation.
